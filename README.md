The **Smart Tutoring System** integrates a variety of advanced technologies to offer a highly interactive and personalized learning experience. It leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to enhance the system’s ability to understand and respond to student queries. NLP is particularly important for extracting information from **PDF documents**, where it processes and converts text data into useful information, breaking it down into tokens. These tokens are then used to generate highlighted notes, which are presented to students, ensuring that key concepts are easily accessible and understood.

The system also incorporates **Edge Computing**, which allows for faster data processing closer to the user. By leveraging edge devices, the system can provide real-time responses and reduce latency, enhancing the overall user experience. On the backend, **MySQL** is used for data management, efficiently storing and retrieving student data, including performance metrics, progress tracking, and generated notes. The **frontend**, built using **PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensures a responsive and engaging user interface, while **Matplotlib** is used for data visualization to track and display student performance through interactive charts and graphs.

In addition to these core features, the system can adapt to each student’s learning needs through personalized content recommendations powered by machine learning models. This combination of NLP for text extraction, edge computing for faster responses, and robust backend technologies creates a powerful and efficient Smart Tutoring System that helps students stay on track with their learning while providing educators with valuable insights into student progress.
